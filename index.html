            <img id="Headshot" src="images/Headshot No Teeth Cropped.jpg">
            <p>Karlton Shoemaker is a dynamic, up-and-coming software developer based in northeast Ohio. His broad educational and professional background has equipped him with a wide skill-set that enables him to succeed in a variety of settings.</p>
            <p>Karlton’s educational background is rooted in the Translation program at the Institute for Applied Linguistics at Kent State University. By completing both a Master’s degree and Bachelor’s degree in translation along with study and teaching abroad experiences in France, Karlton has developed strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills that allow him to analyze and interpret complex and nuanced problems. He is able to solve these problems while keeping in mind the broader context of the situation in order to provide solutions that meet the requirements of all stakeholders.</p>
            <p>This competency is demonstrated by Karlton’s work in the order management department of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (position staffed by Innosource, Inc.). He was hired into this position in January of 2016, and in this role, he maintained relationships with wholesale dealership accounts and supported the order entry and fulfillment processes by coordinating with other departments in Goodyear and acting as a liaison to the customer. For almost five years, Karlton took on more challenging accounts and assignments and even worked as a team lead for the department for several months until he was recalled to his previous position to support one of the biggest wholesale dealers Goodyear sells to.</p>
	<p>As the responsibilities increased and Karlton continued to rise to meet new challenges, he came to the conclusion that although he was on an interesting path with potential opportunities for advancement into business supply chain roles, he did not feel as though this was the best fit for his skills.</p>
	<p>At this point, he determined after intensive research that software development seemed to be the perfect fit for his skills and interests. Karlton was always interested in technology, and his logical mind found a natural appeal for the world of programming. His education in language and translation has allowed him to understand meaning and data structures in a profound way, and he has been able to use this understanding to build his foundation of knowledge in the programming world.</p>
	<p>Karlton is on course to finish the We Can Code IT programming boot camp by the end of April 2021, and his future looks bright. A naturally curious individual and lifelong learner, Karlton is excited to continually expand his understanding of software development and new technologies. He is looking forward to doing great things.</p>

            <p>Karlton began coding in C# in January 2021, and he has already created several interesting projects that display his skills as a developer. See below for descriptions what he is working on!</p>

                    <h3 class="demos">Hockey Simulation</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/karlton-shoemaker/Hockey-Simulation-Game"><img src="./images/Hockey.jpg" alt="Hockey"></a>
                    <p class="demos">Click on the image above to see the github repository for Karlton's Hockey Simulation project. It is a text-adventure game (the term being used liberally) in which you can shoot pucks to try to score goals, defend against shots as a defender or goalie, fight with players on other teams, and serve your time in the penalty box.</p>

                    <h3 class="demos">Guitar Fretboard</h3>
                    <a href="https://github.com/karlton-shoemaker/Guitar-Fretboard"><img src="./images/Fretboard.jpg" alt="Guitar Fretboard"></a>
                    <p class="demos">In one of his first attempts at making a program in C#, Karlton created a console app that will display a diagram of a guitar's fretboard. A user can study various diagrams for left-handed and right-handed configurations. Once they have studied well, the user can challenge themself with a flash-card game to test their knowledge of the fretboard! Click on the image to see the github repository.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/karlton-shoemaker/Random-Pizza-Generator"><img src="./images/Pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza"></a>
                    <p class="demos">Coming soon! Karlton’s current side project is a console app that will randomly generate a pizza order for one of his favorite restaurants. It's not that he can't decide on what he wants as much as he is excited at the thought of having his pizza-eating fate left up to chance. Hopefully, no anchovies!</p>

                    <a href="./DonutClicker/index.html">Donut Clicker Project</a>
                    <p class="demos">As his first foray into a JavaScript Project, Karlton was tasked with creating an interactive game in which a player can click a button to increase their count of donuts. As they accumulate more and more donuts, they can use purchased donuts to buy multipliers and auto-clickers that allow for the procurement of incredible quantities of donuts!</p>
